# TradeSync Migration to Carbon Design System

This document outlines the migration strategy for adopting IBM's Carbon Design System in our TradeSync application.

## Migration Strategy

We're using a gradual approach to migrate components from our custom implementation to Carbon Design System:

1. **Parallel Implementation**: Each component has both a traditional and Carbon version
2. **Feature Flags**: Control which components use Carbon via the feature flags system
3. **Theme Variables**: Shared theme variables ensure consistent styling during transition

## Current Status

| Component | Migration Status | Notes |
|-----------|------------------|-------|
| Theme Variables | âœ… Complete | Carbon theme variables added |
| Sidebar | âœ… Complete | Using Carbon SideNav |
| Header | âœ… Complete | Using Carbon Header + HeaderPanel |
| Market Overview | âœ… Complete | Using Carbon Grid + Tiles |
| Account Summary | âœ… Complete | Using Carbon Tiles + Tabs |
| Positions | âœ… Complete | Using Carbon DataTable |
| AI Insights | âœ… Complete | Using Carbon ContentSwitcher + Tiles |
| Charts | ðŸ”„ In Progress | Pending Carbon Charts integration |
| Forms | ðŸ”„ In Progress | Partial migration of form elements |

## How to Test

You can test the Carbon implementation without changing code using URL parameters:

- `?carbon=all` - Enable all Carbon components
- `?carbon=sidebar,header` - Enable specific components
- `?carbon=none` - Disable all Carbon components

## Benefits of Carbon Design System

- **Enterprise-grade components**: Pre-built, consistent components
- **Accessibility**: Built-in a11y features
- **Performance**: Optimized for React performance
- **Themability**: Powerful theming capabilities
- **Maintenance**: Reduced custom CSS to maintain

## Known Issues

- Carbon Charts requires additional configuration to work with our data format
- Some Carbon components might need CSS adjustments to match our design exactly
- Full React 19 compatibility testing needed (Carbon officially supports up to React 18)

## Next Steps

1. Complete the migration of all components
2. Add dark/light theme toggle
3. Migrate trading forms to use Carbon forms
4. Enhance mobile responsiveness using Carbon Grid
5. Replace custom charts with Carbon Charts
